## 📘 Frequently Asked Questions

### ❓ What is this project?
**Open V-Pet** is a modern virtual pet engine designed for both hobbyists and commercial use. It features deeper mechanics, better hardware compatibility, and extensive customization — all built from scratch.

---

### ❓ Why is it called *Open V-Pet*?
The name reflects the project’s commitment to open development and community involvement.

- The engine will be **open-sourced** for **non-commercial use** at version 1.0.
- Community feedback and contributions are welcome throughout development.
- Transparency is key — progress updates and technical details are shared often.

---

### ❓ Can I make my own version?
Yes! Once v1.0 is released, the full source code will be available for you to fork, mod, and build your own custom pets or devices.

In the meantime, demo binaries will be provided for supported hardware so you can try it out early.

---

### ❓ What if I can’t code or solder?
That’s okay! There will be:

- Modding tools to create pets, sprites, and behavior — **no programming required**
- Fully-assembled units available for purchase if you want a plug-and-play experience

---

### ❓ Why buy a device instead of building one?
Buying a device:

- Ensures tested hardware with consistent performance
- Includes customization options and official firmware
- Comes with full support for licensed units

DIY users are still welcome to tinker and experiment, but official support will be limited to licensed builds.

---

### ❓ How do I get one?
Small-batch **pre-orders** for early units are happening now and will be announced in the official Discord.

A full production model is planned for release **later this year** (TBD).

- Also runs on other microcontrollers and configurations — the engine is designed to be **portable**

---

### ❓ What language is this coded in?
- Core game engine: **C++**
- Tools and modding utilities: **C++ and Python**

---

### ❓ Can I try it out now?
Yes! A downloadable demo is already available. Keep an eye out for upcoming test builds and hardware drops.

---

### ❓ Is this only for Digimon?
No — Digimon is the initial focus to help flesh out the pet roster.

But the system is **fully open to other franchises** and even original creations — it’s designed to be universal.

---

### ❓ How can I contribute?
- Head to the `#join` channel on Discord and create a thread
- Whether you’re into **art**, **code**, **writing**, or **testing** — there’s room for you here!
